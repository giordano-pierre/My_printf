# my_printf

my_printf is a C project that aims to recreate the functionality of the standard printf function. The printf function is commonly used in C programming for formatted output. This project provides an alternative implementation of printf, allowing developers to have more control and customization over their output.

## Features

- Supports a subset of format specifiers commonly used in printf.
- Allows developers to easily print formatted output to the console or files.
- Provides flexibility in customizing output based on specific needs.
- Supports a variety of data types, including integers, strings, characters, and more.
- Offers support for special formatting options, such as width, precision, and flags.

## Getting Started

To get started with my_printf, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    gitclone https://github.com/your-username/my_printf.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    cd my_printf

3. Compile the source code:

    gcc -o my_printf main.c my_printf.c

4. Run the program:
    ./my_printf

5. Experiment with different format specifiers and customization options to see the output.

## Usage

To use the my_printf function in your own C projects, follow these steps:

1. Copy the "my_printf.c" and "my_printf.h" files into your project directory.

2. Include the "my_printf.h" header file in your source code:

"#include "my_printf.h""

Call the my_printf function in your code, similar to how you would use the standard printf function:

int main() {
    my_printf("Hello, %s! The answer is %d.\n", "world", 42);
    return 0;
}

Compile and run your project to see the output.
